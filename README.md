# 🔥 Roetz-End – Co-Extrusion Hotend (Open Beta)
**by Jan Roetz / Roetz4.0**

---

## 🧠 Overview
The **Roetz-End** is an open-source, high-performance Co-Extrusion Hotend designed for  
**Directional Material Deposition (DMD)** — a process where each filament’s deposition  
is *actively controlled based on the print head’s movement direction.*

This marks the first public release of the Roetz-End concept —  
a platform for multi-material co-extrusion without mixing, purging, or waste.

## ⚙️ Technical Notes
- Four independent melt channels allow **directional placement** of materials or colors.  
- No purge blocks, no priming towers, no poop.  
- Flow rates up to **200 mm³/s** possible (depending on filament).

### Assembly Overview
1. Check all threads if they are deep enough and run freely.  
2. Check hole sizes if heatbreaks and heater cartridges do fit.
3. Wire heater and thermistor into your printers mainboard
4. Screw heatbreaks and nozzle into the hotend (consider using some teflon tape)
5. Heat up Hotend to 250°C, use soft pliers to thread heatbreaks and nozzle in all the way. (Let it cool down afterwards)
6. Marry Hot- and Coldend. Make sure it seats properly and torque down the 3 screws to close the flexure.
